### Data model

I worked with data models briefly quite early on in the Makers course, so I feel a little unfamiliar with them at the moment. I am going to spend some time researching data models and from there start to draw up a diagram.

- A data model is a logical representation of how the data will flow between different data entities and the relationships between them.
